## Downloading and Installing
First download [this](https://download.visualstudio.microsoft.com/download/pr/6a3a8a8b-4aaa-4d3f-bce6-b512f2ef5a2c/e6963fbe57cdd8258a9f0997cc3a6669/windowsdesktop-runtime-3.1.9-win-x64.exe).
Then download the installer [here](https://github.com/lolapus/Beat-Cursor/raw/main/Beat%20Cursor%20Installer.msi). For some of you it might say windows smart screen has blocked the app, you can just click more info and then run anyway to run the installer. You can place your maps here "C:\ProgramData\Beat Cursor\BeatCursor\Maps" once the launcher has downloaded the game.
