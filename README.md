Feel free to join our discord server at https://discord.gg/5Zbkhsa to get some maps for the beta or to report any bugs you find.

## Downloading and Installing
First download .net 3.1 so the installer can run: https://github.com/lolapus/Beat-Cursor/raw/main/Dependencies/windowsdesktop-runtime-3.1.9-win-x64.exe.
Then download the installer [here](https://github.com/lolapus/Beat-Cursor/raw/main/Beat%20Cursor%20Installer.msi). For some of you it might say windows smart screen has blocked the app, you can just click more info and then run anyway to run the installer. You can place your maps here "C:\ProgramData\Beat Cursor\BeatCursor\Maps" once the launcher has downloaded the game.
